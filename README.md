# ZenGardenerBot
This is a basic/bad "bot" for Zen garden in PvZ, i hope for updating this as I learn new things and get better at coding
BotGUI is the one at opening the whole thing, it isnt complete, but is functional (you can get your cursor stuck so move your cursor to the top-left corner on your screen)
(ALL THE IMAGES DIRECTORY MUST BE CHANGED) I don't know how to write it so it "doesn't matter"

Also, first time sharing code i dont know how to do this
