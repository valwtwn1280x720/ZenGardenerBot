# ZenGardenerBot
This is a basic/bad "bot" for Zen garden in PvZ. Its objective is the automation of the care of the Zen garden

It uses pyautogui for the recognition of images on screen as well for the automatization of the clicks and mouse movements.
customtkinter is the one I'm using for the GUI since it looks better than regular tkinter

I hope for updating this as I learn new things and get better at coding
BotGUI is the one at opening the whole thing, it isnt complete, but is functional (you can get your cursor stuck so move your cursor to the top-left corner on your screen)
(ALL THE IMAGES DIRECTORY MUST BE CHANGED) I don't know how to write the code so it recognizes the image in different directories

Also, first time sharing code i dont know how to do this

Things that I wanted to add but didn't for now
- fertilize plants automatically [already done]
- buy things automatically if needed and could afford
- CoinCollecter to collect 50 coins also
